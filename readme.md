* USB Video Class

This is a port to Keil, running on STM32F429I-Disco board, of this [project](https://github.com/iliasam/STM32F4_UVC_Camera "USB Video Class")

There is the Keil project and the .HEX file. 

I use a USB OTG cable to connect the disco board USB to the camera. The camera is a "Microsoft LifeCam HD 3000" model. The resolution is 320x240 MJPEG format.

Many Thanks to iliasam for the code.
